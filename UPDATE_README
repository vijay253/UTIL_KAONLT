The recent update folds in some improvements to the kaonlt.py script from Richard, it also adds a "misc" cuts and param file.

To keep scripts working that are NOT included here, modify the following lines where appropriate -

(Before you specify the readDict)
c = klt.pyPlot(None) --> c = klt.pyPlot(REPLAYPATH)
(Inside the definition of make_cutDict)
c = klt.pyPlot(readDict) -> c = klt.pyPlot(REPLAYPATH,readDict)
(After you specify your cuts)
c = klt.pyPlot(cutDict) -> c = klt.pyPlot(REPLAYPATH,cutDict)
